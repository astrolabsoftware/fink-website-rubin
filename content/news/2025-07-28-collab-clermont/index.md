<!--more-->

Part of the Fink community met in Clermont Ferrand, during a few hot summer days, to discuss the future of Fink and make preparations for the upcoming Rubin data.  

The three days were full with long discussion sessions, heated debates, a few presentations and a lot of dreams and expectations for the near future. 

We also had the opportunity to experiment a little of local culture and cuisine with a visit to the [Chateaux de Murol](https://www.murolchateau.com/).
